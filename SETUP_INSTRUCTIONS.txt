Before you open vscode, ensure that the environmental variables ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME are set
If you are unable to set these environmental varaibles (possibly due to a lack of adminstrative rights over your current system)
Try the following:
    On Windows:
        Set your environmental variables for your LOCAL ACCOUNT (going to the search bar and find the result `Edit environment variables for your account`)
        Close vscode, reopen then clean the workspace (Command Palette > Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace)
            If the libraries are still not being referenced by vscode open up the integrated terminal (default Ctrl+`)
            Then run ./gradlew clean build (assuming the terminal puts you into the project root directory)
            After the command "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", clean the workspace again and it should work (hopefully)
    On MacOS:
        1. Open your terminal
        2. Run the following commands, subsituting as nessesary
            launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME path_to_installation
            launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME path_to_installation(should end with `Home/` if you extaracted the jdk)

            PLEASE USE ABSOLUTE PATH (dont use ~/ or ./)
        3. Ensure that you completely close vscode (should not be available in your dock (taskbar of windows))
        4. Reopen vscode and clean the workspace (Command Palette > Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace)
            If the libraries are still not being referenced by vscode open up the integrated terminal (default Meta+`)
            Then run ./gradlew clean build (assuming the terminal puts you into the project root directory)
            After the command "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", clean the workspace again and it should work (hopefully)

If there is an error saying that it cannot find StringConcatFactory
    1. Set the JDK Runtime in the Project Settings
        Ctrl + Shift + P (open the command palette) > Java: Configure Java Runtime

    OR

    2. add org.gradle.java.home=<jdk installation path> to gradle.properties
        DO NOT PUSH THIS CHANGE TO THE REPOSITORY
