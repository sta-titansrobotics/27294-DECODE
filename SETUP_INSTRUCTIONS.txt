Before you open vscode, ensure that the environmental variables ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME are set
    On Windows:
        Set your environmental variables for your LOCAL ACCOUNT (going to the search bar and find the result `Edit environment variables for your account`)
        Close vscode, reopen then clean the workspace (Command Palette > Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace)
            If the libraries are still not being referenced by vscode open up the integrated terminal (default Ctrl+`)
            Then run ./gradlew clean build (assuming the terminal puts you into the project root directory)
            After the command "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", clean the workspace again and it should work (hopefully)
    On MacOS:
        1. Open your terminal
        2. Run the following commands, subsituting as nessesary
            launchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME path_to_installation (https://developer.android.com/tools/sdkmanager)
            launchctl setenv JAVA_HOME path_to_installation(should end with `Home/` if you extaracted the jdk)

            PLEASE USE ABSOLUTE PATH (dont use ~/ or ./)
            [?] If you are already in the folder with the installation, you may substitute path_to_installation with "`PWD`"
        3. Ensure that you completely close vscode (should not be available in your dock (taskbar of windows))
        4. Reopen vscode and clean the workspace (Command Palette > Java: Clean Java Language Server Workspace)
            If the libraries are still not being referenced by vscode open up the integrated terminal (default Meta+`)
            Then run ./gradlew clean build (assuming the terminal puts you into the project root directory)
            After the command "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", clean the workspace again and it should work (hopefully)

        [!] If MacOS gives you a stpid message that java "may" contain a virus. you can bypass it using the following:
            1. Go to where your jdk is (it is where you set your JAVA_HOME variable)
            2. Copy the macos-jdk-perm-fix.sh file from this project into that folder
            3. In your terminal run the file
                [?] If you do not have permission use chmod +x macos-jdk-perm-fix.sh
                [?] then run the command again

If there is an error saying that it cannot find StringConcatFactory
    1. Set the JDK Runtime in the Project Settings
        Ctrl + Shift + P (open the command palette) > Java: Configure Java Runtime

    OR

    2. add org.gradle.java.home=<jdk installation path> to gradle.properties
        DO NOT PUSH THIS CHANGE TO THE REPOSITORY
